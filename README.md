# Paperfork

Find where the paper forked from the repo — and draft the merge commit.

Paperfork is a Hermes-powered research audit agency. Give it an arXiv ID or DOI plus a GitHub repository URL. It fans out Literature, Repo, and Web agents in parallel, runs deterministic fork rules, judges gaps with Hermes, and delivers a Fork Report with GitHub issue drafts and README patches.

## What it does

1. **Literature agent** — arXiv + Semantic Scholar paper metadata, neighbor papers, abstract claims
2. **Repo agent** — GitHub tree, README, seeds/splits/metrics extractors, code structure pass
3. **Web agent** — Linkup deep search for Papers With Code, HuggingFace, author pages
4. **Fork rules** — deterministic checks (cross-validation, seeds, metrics, repro gaps)
5. **Judge + gap-filler** — Hermes merges findings into Fork Report JSON
6. **Outputs** — GitHub issue body, README patch, ElevenLabs voice brief, cron re-audit delta

## Partner stack

| Partner | Role |
|---------|------|
| Hermes | Orchestrator, governance, Telegram, memory, cron, judge LLM |
| Convex | All state, scheduler, agent actions, real-time UI |
| Linkup | Web agent deep search (`LINKUP_PROMO=HERMES`) |
| Cloudflare | Next.js 15 on Pages; DNS CNAME `paperfork` |
| ElevenLabs | Voice brief on report complete + cron delta |

Power-ups: +25 each when mentors see real use in the build.

## Architecture

```
User (web or Telegram)
  → Hermes orchestrator
  → parallel: Literature | Repo+structure | Web(Linkup)
  → fork-rules.ts (deterministic, non-negotiable)
  → load memories for repo owner
  → Judge (Hermes) → scaleEval on failure (max 2 rounds)
  → gap-filler → report + GitHub issue + README patch + voice
  → retrofit memories → optional cron re-audit
```

All tables (`audits`, `agentOutputs`, `reports`, `userRequests`, `sessions`, `memories`, `cronJobs`, `githubOutputs`) exist from schema day one. Session forensics logs every agent step. Memories recall recurring gaps per repo owner.
